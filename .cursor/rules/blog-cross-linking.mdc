# Blog Cross-Linking Review Rule

## Overview
Always review new blog posts for cross-linking opportunities with existing content to improve SEO, reader engagement, and content authority.

## Cross-Linking Process

### 1. Content Analysis
When creating or editing blog posts in [docs/writing/posts/](mdc:docs/writing/posts/), analyze the content for:
- Key topics and themes
- Technical concepts mentioned
- Related problems or solutions discussed
- Personal experiences or case studies referenced

### 2. Cross-Link Identification
Use the [sitemap.yaml](mdc:sitemap.yaml) to identify potential cross-links by:
- Searching for related topics in existing post summaries
- Looking for complementary content that builds on the current post
- Finding posts that provide deeper context or alternative perspectives
- Identifying posts that address related problems or use cases

### 3. Natural Link Integration
Add cross-links naturally within the content:
- Link to foundational concepts when introducing new topics
- Reference related posts when discussing similar problems
- Connect to follow-up content that builds on current ideas
- Link to personal experiences or case studies when relevant

### 4. Cross-Link Categories to Consider

#### RAG & AI Content
- Link RAG posts to each other (rag-what-is-rag.md → rag-improving-rag.md)
- Connect AI engineering posts (ai-engineering-leaders.md → ai-engineering-standup.md)
- Reference technical tutorials and guides

#### Consulting & Business
- Link consulting strategy posts (consulting-start.md → consulting-everything-i-know.md)
- Connect pricing and marketing content
- Reference client case studies and lessons learned

#### Personal Growth & Career
- Link advice and reflection posts (advice.md → self-loathing.md → getting-goals.md)
- Connect career development content
- Reference personal experiences and lessons

#### Technical Content
- Link related technical tutorials and guides
- Connect tool reviews and comparisons
- Reference code examples and implementations

### 5. Link Quality Standards
- Ensure links provide genuine value to readers
- Use descriptive anchor text that explains the destination
- Avoid over-linking (aim for 2-5 relevant cross-links per post)
- Prioritize links to your most important/popular content

### 6. Review Checklist
Before finalizing any blog post, verify:
- [ ] Content has been analyzed for cross-linking opportunities
- [ ] Relevant existing posts have been identified using sitemap.yaml
- [ ] Cross-links are naturally integrated into the content
- [ ] Links use descriptive anchor text
- [ ] No more than 5 cross-links per post (unless highly relevant)
- [ ] Links point to complementary or foundational content

## Implementation Notes
- Use the sitemap.yaml summaries to quickly identify related content
- Focus on creating a web of interconnected, valuable content
- Consider the reader's journey and what additional context would be helpful
- Update cross-links when adding new related content
