# Writing and Mumblings

I write about applied AI, open source, personal work, and building with LLMs.

If you want hands-on help, I recommend reaching out to my friend Nila: [nila.is](https://nila.is/). Please mention you came from me.

## RAG and Retrieval Systems

[Only 6 Evals](./posts/rag-only-6-evals.md) - that's all you need. [Predictions](./posts/rag-plusplus.md) explores where RAG is heading. [Improving RAG](./posts/rag-improving-rag.md) is the systematic process I use. [Levels of Complexity](./posts/rag-levels-of-rag.md) breaks down implementation layers. [Systematically Improving](./posts/systematically-improving-rag-raindrop.md) goes beyond error tracking.

[The Flywheel](./posts/rag-flywheel.md) creates self-reinforcing improvement cycles. [Terrible RAG](./posts/rag-inverted.md) catalogs what not to do. [Low-Hanging Fruit](./posts/rag-low-hanging-fruit.md) covers quick wins that often outperform complex changes. [What Is RAG](./posts/rag-what-is-rag.md) covers the fundamentals. [More Than Embeddings](./posts/rag.md) shows how query understanding changes everything.

[Decomposition](./posts/rag-decomposition.md) breaks complex queries into simpler parts. [Authority](./posts/rag-authority.md) explains why learning-to-rank beats pure embedding search. [Search Metrics](./posts/rag-lgtmk.md) measures quality. [Anti-Patterns](./posts/rag-anti-patterns-skylar.md) documents failures I've seen across industries.

## AI Engineering and Process

[Common Errors](./posts/stochastic-software.md) catalogs mistakes in probabilistic systems. [Fine-Tuning Foot Guns](./posts/few-shot-foot-guns.md) covers what not to do. [Enterprise Embeddings](./posts/glean-finetuning.md) shows how Glean builds custom models. [Data Illiteracy](./posts/data-literacy.md) explains common mistakes. [Hard Truths](./posts/ai-truths.md) from watching companies burn millions.

[Effective Communication](./posts/ai-engineering-communication.md) moves beyond vague updates. [Leading Teams](./posts/ai-engineering-leaders.md) connects work to business value. [AI Standups](./posts/ai-engineering-standup.md) explains why AI is applied research, not engineering. [Hiring MLEs](./posts/hiring.md) explains when to hire (spoiler: later than you think). [LLM Observability](./posts/llmops.md) uses Open Telemetry, not fancy tools. [Data Flywheel](./posts/data-flywheel.md) builds self-improving systems.

## Context Engineering

[Beyond Chunks](./posts/context-engineering-tool-response.md) shows how faceted search gives agents peripheral vision. [Rapid Prototyping](./posts/context-engineering-agent-prototyping.md) validates ideas with folder tests. [Slash vs Subagents](./posts/context-engineering-slash-commands-subagents.md) solves context pollution - same capability, dramatically different economics. [Compaction Experiments](./posts/context-engineering-compaction.md) explores using compaction as momentum. [Agent Frameworks](./posts/context-engineering-agent-frameworks.md) helps choose autonomy levels.

## Coding Agents

[Grep Beats Embeddings](./posts/talks/colin-rag-agents.md) from Augment shows simple tools win. [No Multi-Agents](./posts/talks/devin-cognition-multi-agents.md) explains the telephone game effect. [Stopped Using RAG](./posts/talks/rag-is-dead-cline-nik.md) from Cline makes the case for direct exploration. [Rethinking RAG](./posts/talks/sourcegraph-agentic-code-agent-rag.md) from Sourcegraph inverts chat-era assumptions.

## Business and Product

[AI MVPs](./posts/mvp.md) focuses on what 80% means. [Pricing Agents](./posts/business-pricing-tools-agents.md) compares to headcount, not tooling budgets. [Revenue Sharing](./posts/lovable-pricing-outcomes.md) explores outcome-based pricing.

## Personal Stories

[Advice](./posts/advice.md) for those starting out. [Losing My Hands](./posts/hands-part-1.md) forced reinvention. [Learning to Learn](./posts/learning.md) across pottery, weightlifting, jiu jitsu, Rocket League. [Things](./posts/things.md) is a running list of what I'm using.
