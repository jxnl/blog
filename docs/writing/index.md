# Writing and mumblings

I write about applied AI, open source, personal work, and building with LLMs.

If you want hands-on help, I recommend reaching out to my friend Nila: [nila.is](https://nila.is/). Please mention you came from me.

## RAG and Retrieval Systems

[only 6 evals](./posts/rag-only-6-evals.md) - that's all you need. [predictions](./posts/rag-plusplus.md) explores where RAG is heading. [improving rag](./posts/rag-improving-rag.md) is the systematic process I use. [levels of complexity](./posts/rag-levels-of-rag.md) breaks down implementation layers. [systematically improving](./posts/systematically-improving-rag-raindrop.md) goes beyond error tracking.

[the flywheel](./posts/rag-flywheel.md) creates self-reinforcing improvement cycles. [terrible rag](./posts/rag-inverted.md) catalogs what not to do. [low-hanging fruit](./posts/rag-low-hanging-fruit.md) covers quick wins that often outperform complex changes. [what is rag](./posts/rag-what-is-rag.md) covers the fundamentals. [more than embeddings](./posts/rag.md) shows how query understanding changes everything.

[decomposition](./posts/rag-decomposition.md) breaks complex queries into simpler parts. [authority](./posts/rag-authority.md) explains why learning-to-rank beats pure embedding search. [search metrics](./posts/rag-lgtmk.md) measures quality. [anti-patterns](./posts/rag-anti-patterns-skylar.md) documents failures I've seen across industries.

## AI Engineering and Process

[common errors](./posts/stochastic-software.md) catalogs mistakes in probabilistic systems. [fine-tuning foot guns](./posts/few-shot-foot-guns.md) covers what not to do. [enterprise embeddings](./posts/glean-finetuning.md) shows how Glean builds custom models. [data illiteracy](./posts/data-literacy.md) explains common mistakes. [hard truths](./posts/ai-truths.md) from watching companies burn millions.

[effective communication](./posts/ai-engineering-communication.md) moves beyond vague updates. [leading teams](./posts/ai-engineering-leaders.md) connects work to business value. [ai standups](./posts/ai-engineering-standup.md) explains why AI is applied research, not engineering. [hiring mles](./posts/hiring.md) explains when to hire (spoiler: later than you think). [llm observability](./posts/llmops.md) uses Open Telemetry, not fancy tools. [data flywheel](./posts/data-flywheel.md) builds self-improving systems.

## Context Engineering

[beyond chunks](./posts/context-engineering-tool-response.md) shows how faceted search gives agents peripheral vision. [rapid prototyping](./posts/context-engineering-agent-prototyping.md) validates ideas with folder tests. [slash vs subagents](./posts/context-engineering-slash-commands-subagents.md) solves context pollution - same capability, dramatically different economics. [compaction experiments](./posts/context-engineering-compaction.md) explores using compaction as momentum. [agent frameworks](./posts/context-engineering-agent-frameworks.md) helps choose autonomy levels.

## Coding Agents

[grep beats embeddings](./posts/talks/colin-rag-agents.md) from Augment shows simple tools win. [no multi-agents](./posts/talks/devin-cognition-multi-agents.md) explains the telephone game effect. [stopped using rag](./posts/talks/rag-is-dead-cline-nik.md) from Cline makes the case for direct exploration. [rethinking rag](./posts/talks/sourcegraph-agentic-code-agent-rag.md) from Sourcegraph inverts chat-era assumptions.

## Business and Product

[ai MVPs](./posts/mvp.md) focuses on what 80% means. [pricing agents](./posts/business-pricing-tools-agents.md) compares to headcount, not tooling budgets. [revenue sharing](./posts/lovable-pricing-outcomes.md) explores outcome-based pricing.

## Personal Stories

[advice](./posts/advice.md) for those starting out. [losing my hands](./posts/hands-part-1.md) forced reinvention. [learning to learn](./posts/learning.md) across pottery, weightlifting, jiu jitsu, Rocket League.
