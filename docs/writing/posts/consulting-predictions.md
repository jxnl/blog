# Why Freelancers Will Win the AI Gold Rush

I remember stories about the tech booms of past decades. In the late 1990s, the web revolution began. Teenagers who knew HTML were earning thousands per project, building websites for local businesses. In the late 2000s, a similar trend emerged with mobile apps. Young developers were profiting from creating applications for smartphones.

"This is the future," people would say. Many were skeptical about how these basic websites or simple apps could change anything. We know how those predictions turned out.

Now, in 2024, I'm feeling the same way about AI freelancers and consultants. But this time, I'm not skeptical. I believe we're at the start of something significant, a change that will surpass the web and mobile revolutions in its impact.

Here's why:

## The Builders of the AI Revolution

Every revolution needs its builders. The web revolution needed web developers. The mobile revolution needed app developers. Now, the AI revolution needs AI specialists - but with a crucial twist.

Unlike building websites or apps, which follow relatively straightforward processes, creating effective AI systems is a complex endeavor. It demands a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, data structures, and often, intricate domain-specific knowledge. This complexity is a double-edged sword: it's challenging, yet immensely rewarding.

## Appetite

Marc Andreessen famously said that software is eating the world. Now, AI is eating software.

Every company, in every industry, is scrambling to integrate AI. They need chatbots, recommendation systems, report generation, and more. But most of them don't have the in-house expertise to build these systems. Deterministic software is being replaced by probabilistic software and most people don't know how to manage the gap.

## The Lucky Ones

In every technological revolution, there's a group of people who are in the right place at the right time. They're the lucky ones. Web developers in the late 90s. Mobile developers in the late 2000s.

Today, it's AI specialists. They're the lucky ones of our era. They have skills that are in high demand and short supply. They can command high rates, choose interesting projects, and work from anywhere in the world.

But here's the really interesting part: AI freelancers aren't just participants in this revolution. They're also beneficiaries of it.

## The Self-Improving Freelancer

Imagine a web developer who could create tools that automatically made them a better web developer. Or an app developer whose apps helped them build better apps.

That's the position AI freelancers are in. They can use AI to automate their own workflows, enhance their productivity, and even augment their skills.

Need to write a proposal? Use an AI to draft it. Need to analyze a client's data? AI can help with that too. Need to stay up-to-date with the latest AI research? There's an AI for that.

It's like having a super-intelligent assistant who's an expert in your field. Except you built the assistant yourself, document that and dogfood your own processes.

## The Compounding Advantage

This creates a compounding advantage. AI freelancers can take on more projects, deliver better results, and continuously improve their skills faster than anyone else. Your exposure to many domains allows you to get closer to the core of the problem and become an expert at solving it while everyone is still struggling with data integrations and ETL.

## Why Freelancing Trumps VC and Indie Building

At this point, you might be wondering: "If AI is so hot, why not start a VC-backed AI startup? Or become an indie AI builder?"

These are good questions. After all, we've seen AI startups raise massive rounds, and indie hackers build impressive AI tools. So why am I bullish on AI freelancing?

Let me answer with an analogy from the construction industry.

In the world of AI, you're not the bricklayer, nor are you the real estate investor or the developer. You're the architect.

The bricklayer (the coder) is crucial, but they're focused on individual tasks. The real estate investor (the VC) has the capital but often lacks the technical know-how. The developer (the startup founder) has the vision but might not have the broad expertise needed to execute it perfectly.

As an AI freelancer, you're the architect. You understand the big picture and the minute details. You can draft the blueprints, oversee the construction, and ensure that the final product meets both the aesthetic vision and the functional requirements.

And here's the beautiful part: you get to work on many different "buildings."

- You might design an AI chatbot for a startup
- Then create a recommendation engine for an e-commerce giant
- Then work on a writing assistant for a marketing agency

And you're getting paid for this exposure.

This doesn't mean you should never become a developer or an investor in the AI space. But freelancing first? That's like getting paid to solve real problems with real clients without the debt and drama of running a startup.

You're learning what problems businesses really have. You're seeing where AI succeeds and fails in the real world. You're building a portfolio that showcases your versatility and expertise. Then if you have a great idea, you already have a network of people who are feeling the pain points you just solved for clients.

And you're doing it all while earning a great income and retaining your independence.

## The Window of Opportunity

But here's the thing about opportunities like this: they don't last forever.

Remember those web developers from the 90s? The ones who got in early did phenomenally well. But by the mid-2000s, the market was saturated. The same thing happened with mobile developers a decade later.

Right now, we're in the early stages of the AI boom. The demand for AI architects far outstrips the supply. But this won't always be the case.

As AI education catches up with demand, as more people realize the opportunity, competition will increase. The window will start to close.

## What This Means for You

So, what are the implications for you?

If you're already in tech with AI expertise, you're well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. However, it's crucial to act swiftly. Begin freelancing, establish your reputation, and leverage AI to enhance your productivity. Remember, this window of opportunity is time-sensitive.

For those with technical backgrounds but limited AI experience, now is the time to upskill. The current AI landscape offers numerous resources and tools to facilitate your learning journey.
