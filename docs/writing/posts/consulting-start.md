# How to Get Started in AI Consulting:

Picture this: You're sitting at your desk, contemplating the leap into AI consulting. Maybe you're a seasoned ML engineer looking to transition from contractor to consultant, or perhaps you've been building AI products and want to branch out independently. Whatever brought you here, you're wondering how to transform your technical expertise into a thriving consulting practice.

I get it. A few years ago, I was in your shoes. After [a hand injury](./hands-part-1.md) forced me to step back from intensive coding, I had to rethink my career path. What started as a necessity evolved into an incredible journey – my consulting business now generates $50,000-$120,000 monthly through [expert calls](https://cal.com/jasonliu/expert-call-55-minutes), with more flexibility and fewer hours than my previous engineering role.

I've documented everything I've learned along the way: from [setting up the essential consulting tech stack](./consulting-stack.md) and [marketing strategies that actually work](./consulting-marketing.md), to [building referral networks](./consulting-referrals.md) and [transitioning from contractor to consultant](./consulting-indie.md). But before diving into those specifics, let me share the fundamental principles that took me years to figure out. Drawing from my experience [building AI applications](./mvp.md) and working with early-stage companies, I'll walk you through what I wish someone had told me when I started this journey.

## The Foundation: Your Value Proposition

First, let's bust a myth: You don't need to be an AI researcher with a PhD to be a successful consultant. What you need is to understand this simple equation:

Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Success) ÷ (Time to Success × Perceived Difficulty)

Let me break this down with a real example:

> A client came to me struggling with their RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Their dream outcome? Reducing customer support costs by 30%. Instead of saying "I can help build your RAG system," I said: "I can help you achieve that 30% cost reduction in 8 weeks instead of 6 months, and I'll show you exactly how we'll get there."

See the difference? I wasn't selling my time or technical skills – I was selling an outcome.

## Your First Steps: Creating Your Flywheel

Here's what you should do in your first 30 days:

1. **Pick Your Niche**

   - Instead of saying "I'm an AI consultant," pick a specific problem you solve
   - Example: "I help B2B SaaS companies reduce customer churn using AI-powered support systems"

2. **Create Your Content Strategy**

   - Start with 2-3 detailed blog posts about problems you've solved
   - Share insights on Twitter/LinkedIn (aim for 3-5 posts per week)
   - Focus on outcomes, not just technical details

3. **Set Up Your Basic Stack**
   - Business basics: LLC, business bank account (I recommend Mercury)
   - Tools: Calendar scheduling (Cal.com), proposal software (I use Dropbox Sign)
   - Don't overcomplicate this – you can upgrade later

## Landing Your First Clients

Here's what nobody tells you about getting your first clients: The best ones often come from the most unexpected places. Here's my three-pronged approach:

1. **Warm Outreach Script**

   > "Hey [Name], I noticed you're working on [specific AI project]. I recently helped [Company X] solve a similar challenge, reducing their implementation time by 60%. Would you be open to a 15-minute chat about how I might be able to help?"

2. **Free Content Strategy**

   - Write detailed posts solving specific problems
   - Share them in relevant communities
   - Offer quick, valuable insights in community discussions

3. **The "Small Wins" Approach**
   - Start with smaller, focused projects
   - Deliver exceptional value
   - Ask for referrals using this script:
     > "What part of our work together did you find most valuable? Do you know anyone else who might be facing similar challenges?"

## Pricing Your Services

Stop thinking about hourly rates. Instead, use the "Airline Model":

- **Economy Class:** Basic implementation support ($X/month)
- **Business Class:** Implementation + strategy ($2X/month)
- **First Class:** Full accountability for outcomes ($3-4X/month)

I learned this the hard way when I undercharged a client at $170/hour. They accepted so quickly, I knew I'd left money on the table. Now, I focus on value-based pricing and typically start engagements at $15,000/month minimum.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **The Expertise Trap**

   - Don't wait until you feel "ready" – you know more than you think
   - Focus on solving specific problems rather than being a generalist

2. **The Time-for-Money Trap**

   - Avoid hourly billing if possible
   - Structure engagements around outcomes and value

3. **The Portfolio Trap**
   - You don't need a perfect portfolio to start
   - Use detailed blog posts to demonstrate expertise instead

## Your Next Steps

Here's your action plan for the next 7 days:

1. Write down three specific problems you can solve with AI
2. Create one detailed blog post about solving one of these problems
3. Reach out to three people in your network who might need help with these problems

Remember: The goal isn't to build a perfect consulting business overnight. It's to start helping people solve real problems with AI while building a sustainable practice.

The world needs more good AI consultants. Not just people who can implement algorithms, but those who can bridge the gap between technical possibilities and business outcomes. That could be you.
