## Preview: Questions We Tackle in Office Hours

These are representative of the practical topics we work through together.

- How do we introduce time and vector search without moving to a graph database?
- Is knowledge graph RAG production ready? Do you recommend it?
- Would you recommend ColBERT or other specialized retrieval approaches?
- Are we going to cover fundamentals of how to systematically do generation?
- What’s your take on using RAG for report generation (RFPs)?
- What is your experience using reasoning models as the answer generator?
- How do we set user expectations on the delay with reasoning models?
- How should we handle multiple RAG sources with different levels of information?
- Are there open source re-rankers close to Cohere’s?
- What are the best practices for chunking very long documents?
- How does a long context window affect RAG systems? Does it make RAG obsolete?
- What strategies can improve experimentation speed with RAG systems?
- How would you evaluate parsing strategies for weird layouts, tables, and charts?
- What’s the process for fine-tuning embedding models and when to use re-rankers?
- What failure modes show up with synthetic data for retrieval fine-tuning?
- When should we create targeted summaries vs. fine-tune embeddings?
- How do you handle multilingual RAG?
- How do you handle upkeep and versioning as documents change?
