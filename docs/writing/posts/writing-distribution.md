# On Getting Recognized: The Unexpected Price of Online Success

I never thought I'd be writing about the challenges of being recognized in public. A year ago, I was just another data scientist trying to build connections and establish myself in the field. Now, I'm grappling with the unintended consequences of my growing online presence. Here's how it all unfolded, and what I've learned about the price of distribution in the digital age.

## Why I Grew My Twitter Account

My journey into the world of online influence began with two simple goals:

1. Build a network: After moving back to Canada, I needed a way to connect with like-minded professionals in my field.
2. Gain visibility for speaking engagements: As I embarked on a speaking tour, I wanted to ensure I'd be noticeable in my industry.

Little did I know how dramatically these efforts would change my day-to-day life.

## The Initial Thrill of Recognition

At first, being recognized was exhilarating. In San Francisco, it happened once or twice a week; in New York City, maybe once a month. It felt validating to know that my work and ideas were making an impact. Whether it was advice, business insights, or my Python library [instructor](https://useinstructor.com), people were connecting with my content in the real world.

## The AI Conference: When Fun Turns to Overwhelm

The recent AI engineering conference in San Francisco marked a turning point. Day one was enjoyable - I even joked about treating people to a spa day if I got recognized more than 10 times. But as the days wore on, the constant attention became overwhelming.

!!! note "Popular Talk"
My talk from last year had been a hit, nearly the most popular of the entire conference until Jerry edged me out.

By day three, I was struggling. Every conversation in the hallway attracted a crowd. As an inherently shy person (hence my preference for Twitter), I found myself retreating to my hotel room just to have a moment's peace.

## When Recognition Becomes Disruptive

Some encounters crossed the line from flattering to frankly bizarre:

- A gym-goer approached me mid-squat (seriously, who does that?)
- An Uber driver held me hostage to pitch their AI startup
- Uninvited eavesdroppers constantly tried to insert themselves into my conversations

!!! warning "Anxiety Rising"
By the end of the conference, I was getting anxious just stepping into the elevator, knowing I'd be recognized as soon as I left.

## The Impact on Work and Personal Time

The constant recognition began to interfere with both my professional and personal life:

- Client meetings were interrupted by well-meaning fans
- Meaningful conversations at the conference became nearly impossible
- I had to start scheduling meetings outside the conference venue just to get work done

## Moving Forward: Adapting to a New Reality

This experience has been a wake-up call. Going forward, I'll need to be more strategic about my public appearances:

- Limiting my time at conferences to just my speaking slot
- Hosting curated office hours instead of open-ended networking
- Being more conscious about my visibility in public spaces

## The Price of Distribution

While I don't consider myself a full-fledged influencer (maybe a micro-influencer at best), I'm learning that this is the cost of having a platform. And despite the challenges, I still believe in the importance of sharing my message.

!!! quote "Personal Reflection"
"I still believe in the message. I think people's systems should be simpler. I think processes are more important than tools. I want to teach people, especially because now that I can't really code anymore due to my hand injury."

Distribution is crucial if you truly believe in your message. But as I've learned, it comes with a price. While I don't expect this level of recognition in my daily life, conferences and industry events will require a new approach.

This journey has been a stark reminder of the double-edged sword of online influence. As we build our platforms and share our ideas, we must also be prepared for the real-world implications of our digital success.
