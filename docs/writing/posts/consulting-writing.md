I want to share something that completely changed my consulting business: **writing consistently**.

Last month, a founder reached out saying, "I don't know who you are, but your blog posts keep showing up in our team's Slack. Are you available to help us?"

Two days later, we closed a $140,000 deal (for a 3-month project). Only 3 sales calls were needed.

This wasn't luck â€“ it was the compound effect of putting words on the page every single day.

**Here's what happened when I committed to writing:**

- My Twitter grew from 500 to 28,000 followers in 16 months
- I now get 4-5 quality inbound leads per month
- My close rate hit 50%

But the real magic? **The quality of clients improved dramatically.**

Instead of explaining what I do, clients now come to me already understanding my expertise. They've read my thoughts on RAG systems, seen my takes on AI architecture, and resonated with my approach to solving problems.

## The Writing Flywheel

Here's how I built my content engine:

1. **Turn every client call into content**

   - Record calls (with permission)
   - Extract common questions and challenges
   - Write about solutions I provided

2. **Share insights from actual work**

   - Document real problems I solve
   - Show my thinking process
   - Include specific examples (anonymized)

3. **Create different content types**
   - Long-form blog posts for depth
   - Twitter threads for reach
   - Newsletter updates for nurturing

The best part? Writing compounds. That blog post you write today could bring you clients months or years from now.

## Start Small, But Start Now

You don't need to write a book. Start with:

- One tweet per day
- One blog post per week
- One newsletter every two weeks

Even 30 minutes of writing per day adds up to 182 hours of content creation per year.

**Remember:** You're not writing to go viral. You're writing to demonstrate expertise and attract the right clients.

> "Your content is often the first interview with a potential client. Make it count."

## Write for Impact

Every piece of content I create follows these guidelines:

1. **AIDA Framework**

   - Attention: Hook readers in the first sentence
   - Interest: Share a compelling story or statistic
   - Desire: Show them what's possible
   - Action: Give them a clear next step

2. **Keep It Digestible**

   - Aim for 5-minute reads
   - Write at a Grade 10 reading level
   - Break up long paragraphs
   - Use headers and bullet points

3. **Make It Scannable**
   - Bold key points
   - Use subheadings every 3-4 paragraphs
   - Include plenty of white space
   - Add relevant examples

This structure works whether you're writing a tweet thread or a full blog post. The key is making complex ideas accessible.

## Make It Easy on Yourself

Here's my actual process:

1. Record a 5-minute voice memo about something I helped a client with
2. Use Whisper to transcribe it
3. Clean it up with Claude
4. Post it

That's it. No fancy editing, no perfect prose. Just valuable insights shared consistently.

The key is to write about what you know. What seems obvious to you might be exactly what your dream client is struggling with right now.

## Your Next Steps

1. Set a simple writing goal (e.g., one LinkedIn post per day)
2. Block 30 minutes each morning for writing
3. Record your client calls (with permission)
4. Extract insights and turn them into content

The sooner you start, the sooner you'll build that valuable content library that works for you 24/7.
