# Optimizing Tool Retrieval in RAG Systems: A Balanced Approach

!!! note "RAG Course"

    This is based on a conversation that came up during office hours from my [RAG course](https://maven.com/applied-llms/rag-playbook) for engineering leaders. There's another cohort that's coming up soon, so if you're interested in that, you can sign up [here](https://maven.com/applied-llms/rag-playbook).

When it comes to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, one of the key challenges is deciding how to select and use tools effectively. As someone who's spent countless hours optimizing these systems, many people ask me whether or not they should think about using retrieval to choose which tools to put into the prompt. What this actually means is that we're interested in making precision and recall trade-offs. I've found that the key lies in balancing recall and precision. Let me break down my approach and share some insights that could help you improve your own RAG implementations.

In this article, we'll cover:

1. The challenge of tool selection in RAG systems
2. Understanding the recall vs. precision tradeoff
3. The "Evergreen Tools" strategy for optimizing tool selection

## The Recall vs. Precision Tradeoff

First, let's consider the typical scenario: You have a large set of tools (let's say 30) at your disposal. If you include all of them in your prompt, you're essentially aiming for 100% recall, but at the cost of precision. Why? Because having too many irrelevant tools can confuse the language model. In terms of the correct tool retrieval, you'll have 100% recall and 1/30 precision.

!!! note "Assumption"

    It's important to note that this discussion assumes only one tool is being used at a time. In reality, multiple tools might be used in combination, which could affect the precision and recall calculations.

This is where retrieval comes in. By using retrieval to inform tool selection, you're making a conscious decision to potentially lower recall in exchange for improved precision. It's a delicate balance, but one that can significantly enhance your system's performance.

## The 80-20 Rule of Tool Usage

Here's a little secret I've discovered: In most RAG systems, tool usage follows the Pareto principle. That means about 20% of your tools are likely being used for 80% of the use cases. This insight is the leverage you need to make informed decisions about tool selection.

!!! note "The Power of Data Analysis"

    Don't just guess which tools are most important. Dive into your usage data. Look at successful API calls, analyze thumbs-up feedback, and create a histogram of tool usage. A simple cumulative sum will reveal which tools are your heavy hitters.

## The Evergreen Tools Strategy

Based on this 80-20 insight, I recommend the following approach:

1. Identify your "evergreen" tools - the 20% that handle most use cases.
2. Always include these evergreen tools in your prompt. They're your baseline, ensuring a solid lower bound on recall at 80% for example.
3. For the remaining tools, use retrieval methods. This could involve query analysis or embedding-based matching to pull in relevant specialized tools as needed.

This strategy gives you the best of both worlds. You maintain high recall for common scenarios while improving precision for edge cases.

## Implementing the Strategy

Here's how you can put this into practice:

1. Analyze your data: Look at successful API calls and user feedback (like thumbs-up data).
2. Create a histogram of tool usage for these successful interactions.
3. Use a cumulative sum to identify which tools account for the majority of successful cases.
4. Designate these top performers as your "evergreen" tools.
5. Implement a retrieval system for the remaining tools, based on query analysis or embeddings, essentially using a summary index where the embeddings point to the tool information.

By doing this, you're not just guessing anymore - you're letting the data guide your tool selection strategy.

## The Payoff

This approach has several benefits:

- Improved efficiency: You're not wasting resources on rarely-used tools.
- Better precision: By reducing noise from irrelevant tools, you help the language model focus.
- Maintained recall: Your evergreen tools ensure you don't miss common use cases.
- Adaptability: The retrieval component allows you to handle edge cases effectively.

You'll ultimately have better precision characteristics, and then you can decide on how many new examples to include.

Additionally, you can determine whether the improved precision, for example, is worth the additional latency trade-offs of having a secondary search system before doing your chunk retrieval.

## A Word of Caution

Remember, this isn't a one-and-done solution. The world of AI moves fast, and so do user needs. Make sure to regularly revisit your analysis and update your evergreen tool set and retrieval methods accordingly.

Implementing this strategy has helped me significantly improve the performance of RAG systems I've worked on. It's not just about having a lot of tools - it's about using them intelligently. By balancing evergreen tools with smart retrieval, you can create a RAG system that's both powerful and precise.

So, next time you're scratching your head over tool selection in your RAG system, remember: start with data, identify your evergreens, and use retrieval wisely. Your users (and your metrics) will thank you.
