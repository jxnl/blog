# Sunsetting 567 Labs and Open Sourcing the Course Content

I am sunsetting 567 Labs. The courses close today, February 2, 2026.

<!-- more -->

I am open sourcing the written content: course transcripts edited into ebook format. If you took the course, this is the canonical archive. If you did not, it is the cleanest way to read the material end to end.

Highlights from the RAG playbook:

- Product mindset over one-off implementation. Measurement, feedback loops, and improvement cycles first.
- Synthetic eval data to break the cold start and drive systematic improvements.
- Feedback UX that actually works. Ask specific questions and make responses easy.
- Specialized retrieval and routing instead of one-size-fits-all search.

Highlights from the consulting archive:

- Flywheel: content → calls → proof → more content.
- Value equation: `Value = (Dream Outcome × Probability of Success) ÷ (Time × Effort)`.
- Three-option pricing with clear tradeoffs, not a single price.
- Discovery + proposals: five-question discovery, situational assessment structure.
