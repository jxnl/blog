# Creating Content That Converts: My Guide for AI Consultants

This is some of the notes I've taken for [learnindieconsulting.com](https://learnindieconsulting.com)

## Why I Prioritize Content (And Why You Should Too)

Let me share something I wish I'd understood sooner: consistent content creation isn't just a marketing tactic—it's the foundation of a thriving consulting business.

When I started my consulting journey, I was stuck in the time-for-money trap. I'd jump on Zoom calls with prospects, explain the same concepts repeatedly, and wonder why scaling was so difficult. Then I had a realization that changed everything: what if I could have these conversations at scale?

Now I extract blog post ideas from every client call. Every Friday, I review about 17 potential topics from the week's conversations. I test them with social posts, see which ones get traction (some get 700 views, others 200,000), and develop the winners into comprehensive content.

Here's why this approach has transformed my business:

### My Content is My 24/7 Sales Team

Last year, I wrote a post called "RAG is more than embeddings" that generated around 30,000 views on Hacker News. This single piece became one of the biggest catalysts for my consulting business.

The real magic happens when a prospect asks a question, and I can send them a blog post I wrote months ago. It immediately signals that I've already thought deeply about their problem. They think, "This person has already solved the exact challenge I'm facing."

### Breaking Free From Hourly Billing

Content helped me escape the limitations of hourly billing. After getting tired of repeating the same RAG implementation advice at $1,000 per hour, I created a course that's more accessible while freeing my time for higher-value work.

This ladder of offerings at different price points lets clients engage with me at whatever level makes sense for them—from free blog posts to high-end consulting. Without content, this business model wouldn't be possible.

### My Content is My Lab for Testing Ideas

I don't try to perfectly identify my audience before creating. Instead, I use content as a sensor to discover what resonates.

When I started on Twitter, I had about 500 followers. I noticed my follower-to-tweet ratio was around 1.7, meaning if I wanted 10,000 followers, I'd need to write roughly 7,000 tweets. So I committed to consistent creation—it's like losing weight; it depends on how often you're working out.

Volume negates luck, and these efforts compound quickly. Don't wait months—focus on creating volume and consistency.

### Building Long-Term Assets That Appreciate

Every piece of content I create becomes part of a growing library that continuously generates value. Unlike client projects that end, my content:

- Continues attracting leads while I sleep
- Builds upon itself as pieces reference each other
- Serves as the foundation for courses and other products
- Allows me to work with better clients on more interesting problems

Now let me walk you through exactly how I approach content creation, from foundational frameworks to practical execution.

## The Value Equation: The Heart of All Great Content

Everything I create revolves around a simple but powerful formula:

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Probability of Success) ÷ (Time × Effort)
```

This equation isn't just about demonstrating value as a consultant—it's about creating content that resonates deeply with readers.

When I write about RAG implementation, I don't just explain technical details. I show readers:

- The **dream outcome**: "Imagine a system that consistently returns precisely relevant information, dramatically improving user trust and reducing churn"
- How I **increase probability**: "By implementing these three specific retrieval strategies, you can improve precision by 37%"
- How I **reduce time**: "This approach cuts development time from months to weeks"
- How I **minimize effort**: "My framework eliminates the need to manually tune parameters"

This value equation shapes everything—my blog posts, social content, course materials, and sales conversations. It's not just theory; it directly improves how I communicate with clients.

## The AIDA Framework: My Structure for Every Piece

Every piece of content I create follows this proven structure:

- **A**ttention: I grab interest with a hook that speaks directly to a pain point
- **I**nterest: I build credibility with relevant insights and information
- **D**esire: I create a vivid picture of the outcome readers want
- **A**ction: I provide a clear next step

This isn't just marketing-speak. Practicing this framework has made me more articulate during sales conversations and client calls. It's like "wax on, wax off"—you're training communication muscles that serve you across contexts.

Let me share an example of how I applied this to a recent blog post:

**Attention**: "Most RAG systems fail because engineers focus exclusively on embeddings while ignoring three critical components."

**Interest**: "After implementing 20+ RAG systems across industries, I've identified patterns that consistently separate high-performing systems from failures."

**Desire**: "By addressing these overlooked elements, you can build systems that deliver consistently relevant results and earn genuine user trust."

**Action**: "Use my evaluation framework (linked here) to identify the specific weaknesses in your current implementation."

## Crafting Titles That Demand Attention

I've learned that your title isn't just important—it's about 80% of the work. A mediocre post with a compelling title will outperform a brilliant post with a boring title every time.

### Strong vs. Weak Titles: A Tale of Two Approaches

Here's an example from my own experience:

When I first started writing, I'd use titles like: "I spent the weekend playing around with ChatGPT"

This attracted almost no interest because:

- It focused on what I did, not what readers could gain
- It gave no reason to click through
- It didn't specify any outcome or benefit

When I shifted to titles like: "3 ChatGPT Prompts That Doubled My Content Creation Speed"

- Engagement skyrocketed because:
- It quantified the benefit (doubled speed)
- It promised specific, actionable advice (3 prompts)
- It addressed a common pain point (slow content creation)

### My Title Testing Strategy

I never commit to a full article without testing the title first. Here's my process:

1. I create 3-5 different social posts with the same core idea but different framing
2. I track which gets the most engagement
3. I use the winning framing for my full content piece

For example, when writing about pricing strategies, I tested:

- "3 mistakes I made in my AI pricing strategy"
- "How I increased my consulting rates by 200% in 6 months"
- "The psychological barrier preventing consultants from charging what they're worth"
- "Why your AI services are underpriced (and what to do about it)"

The last one generated 4x more engagement than the others, so that became my focus for the full article.

## Finding Your Audience Through Content

One question I hear constantly is: "How do I find my audience?"

My answer might surprise you: I don't try to perfectly identify my audience before creating content. Instead, I create content, see what resonates, and refine my understanding through this feedback loop.

When I built my open-source tool Instructor, I started with a message about wanting a simple tool that does one thing well, without unnecessary complexity. The audience came secondary to the message and dream.

That said, I do have a mental checklist I run through before creating content:

- What specific **role** or **position** is my ideal reader in?
- What **business stage** are they in?
- What **specific pain** are they experiencing?
- What **dream outcome** are they pursuing?
- What has **prevented them** from achieving this outcome?
- How **technically sophisticated** are they?

But I hold these ideas loosely, allowing real-world feedback to refine my understanding.

## Platform Selection: Where to Share Your Thinking

Each platform attracts different audiences and serves different purposes in my content ecosystem:

### Twitter/X: My Testing Ground

I use Twitter as my primary testing ground. With a follower-to-tweet ratio between 0.5-4, I know that generating 10,000 followers requires 2,500-20,000 tweets.

Twitter has been especially valuable for connecting with founders, investors, and technical audiences. Most of my industry relationships—including collaborations with other prominent consultants—came through Twitter.

### LinkedIn: My Corporate Channel

When targeting enterprise clients, VPs, Directors, and corporate decision-makers, I shift to LinkedIn. The content is more formal and business-focused, emphasizing outcomes over technical details.

I've found that LinkedIn works better for corporate/enterprise VP-level content, while Twitter is ideal for founders and investors.

### My Website: The Hub of My Content Ecosystem

I strongly believe in owning your distribution channel. While platforms like Medium or Towards Data Science might seem appealing, they diminish your personal brand.

On my own website, I can publish blog content while also offering email capture and a services page. This creates a journey where people might read my posts over several months before they're ready to explore my services.

I use a simple framework—markdown docs with MkDocs Material—making it easy to edit and maintain content without relying on third-party platforms.

### Email Newsletter: My Most Valuable Asset

The quality of subscribers matters more than quantity. "If you offered me a hundred thousand AI news newsletter subscribers versus 200 CTOs in Silicon Valley, I would probably pay $80,000 for that CTO email list."

I started my newsletter relatively late, after my Twitter following had grown significantly. If you're starting now, make email capture a priority from the beginning.

## My Content Creation Process

Over time, I've developed a systematic approach to creating content that consistently delivers results:

### 1. Idea Generation: Mining for Gold

I extract content ideas from multiple sources:

- **Client conversations**: Every call generates potential topics
- **Social media testing**: I post shorter ideas to see which ones resonate
- **Content gaps**: I identify questions that aren't well answered
- **Personal experience**: I share lessons from my own mistakes and successes

I've automated much of this process. After client calls, I use AI tools to extract potential blog ideas from the transcripts. Every Friday, I review these ideas, identifying patterns and high-potential topics.

### 2. Structuring for Impact

For each piece, I follow this proven structure:

**The Hook (Attention)**
I open with something that immediately grabs attention—a provocative question, surprising statistic, or challenge to conventional wisdom.

For example, instead of starting with "RAG systems are important," I might open with: "90% of RAG implementations fail because they focus on the wrong problem entirely."

**The Value Promise (Interest)**
I clearly state what the reader will learn and why it matters to them specifically.

Example: "In this guide, you'll discover the three overlooked components that determine RAG success—insights I've gathered from implementing systems for companies like X, Y, and Z."

**The Main Content (Desire)**
I deliver actionable insights using specific examples and case studies. I demonstrate expertise without overwhelming with technical details.

The key is focusing on the hierarchy of value. Technical details are often the "lowest pole of value." I've learned that clients care much more about business outcomes than technical implementations.

**The Call to Action (Action)**
I provide a clear next step that aligns with my business goals while offering genuine value.

### 3. Optimization for Different Readers

Before publishing, I optimize for different reading styles:

**For Skimmers**:

- I use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- I include clear subheadings
- I incorporate bullet points and numbered lists
- I bold key points

**For Deep Readers**:

- I include personal stories or examples
- I add visuals where relevant
- I ask thought-provoking questions throughout
- I provide evidence and results

## Distribution: The 80/20 Rule

I spend 20% of my time creating content and 80% on distribution. Here's my approach:

### 1. Repurpose Aggressively

I turn blog posts into tweet threads, convert videos into blog posts, and extract key points for LinkedIn posts. This maximizes the return on every piece of content I create.

When my hands were hurting from typing too much, I started recording videos. This created an efficient workflow:

1. Test ideas with tweets to see what resonates
2. Record short videos about high-performing topics
3. Convert the video transcripts into blog posts

### 2. Cross-Platform Promotion

I share blog posts across all social channels, mention content in relevant communities, and reference past pieces in new content. This creates a network effect where each piece strengthens the others.

### 3. Engagement Amplification

I respond to all comments quickly, tag relevant people who might find my content valuable, and follow up with engaged readers. This turns content into conversations, which often lead to client relationships.

## Measuring What Matters

I track several metrics to evaluate content effectiveness:

1. **Visibility metrics**: Views, impressions, time on page
2. **Engagement metrics**: Shares, comments, saves
3. **Conversion metrics**: Email signups, call bookings
4. **Business impact**: Content referenced in sales calls, deal close rates

The most important question I ask new clients: "How did you find me?" Their answers inform my content strategy.

## TAM Assessment: Who Are You Really Reaching?

I'm strategic about estimating the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for my content:

**Specific vs. General Content**
Highly specific titles reach smaller audiences but convert better. General titles reach larger audiences but convert poorly.

For example, "How to implement a RAG system" reaches a broad audience of developers, while "How to create RAG systems for financial compliance" reaches a tiny audience but with much higher conversion potential.

**Balance TAM with Conversion Potential**
I aim for the sweet spot: content specific enough to convert well but broad enough to reach sufficient potential clients.

## My Content Creation Checklist

Before publishing anything, I run through this mental checklist:

### Pre-Creation

- Have I tested this topic with smaller content first?
- Is this aligned with my business goals and services?
- What platform is most appropriate for this content?

### Creation

- Does my title follow the strong title formula?
- Does my opening hook generate attention?
- Have I used the AIDA framework throughout?
- Does this content reflect the value equation?
- Is my expertise clearly demonstrated?

### Distribution

- Have I planned how to promote this across platforms?
- Can I repurpose this content into multiple formats?
- Are there specific people I should notify about this content?

### Measurement

- What metrics will indicate success for this content?
- How does this content fit into my overall strategy?
- What follow-up content might make sense based on this piece?

## Final Thoughts: Content as a Flywheel

The greatest benefit of consistent content creation is the flywheel effect it creates:

1. Client work generates insights for content
2. Content attracts new clients
3. New clients provide more insights
4. The cycle continues and accelerates

This has allowed me to work with increasingly better clients on more interesting problems at higher rates. My content acts as a filter, attracting people who value my specific expertise and approach.

Remember: Great content doesn't just attract an audience—it attracts the right audience who values your expertise enough to pay for it. And that makes all the difference in building a sustainable, fulfilling consulting business.
