# Affective Consulting: Referrals

I've enjoyed writing about my [indie](./consulting-indie.md) [consulting](./consulting-everything-i-know.md) process and [marketing](./consulting-marketing.md) strategy. Today, I want to share some insights on how to master the art of referrals, especially when you're asking for them and following up.

## The Power of Timing

When you ask for referrals matters. If you're offering a one-time consulting service, ask right after the engagement. For complex B2B consulting solutions, wait until the client has seen results. It's about finding that sweet spot where your client is most satisfied and ready to vouch for you.

## Starting the Conversation

Here's a structure I've found incredibly effective:

"Mary, I appreciate the opportunity we've had to work with you. Can I ask you, in your mind, how do you feel we've been able to help you the most?"

Notice a few things here:

1. I'm putting the ball in their court.
2. I'm getting them to articulate the value they've received.
3. I'm setting the stage for a referral request.

## The Referral Ask

Once they've told you how you've helped, here's your cue:

"With that in mind, who do you know that might be struggling with [insert problem you solved]?"

This approach is powerful because:

- It's specific to the value you've provided
- It frames the referral as helping someone with a problem
- It's open-ended, allowing for multiple referrals

## Diving Deeper

Don't stop at just getting a name. Ask:

"Can you tell me a little bit more about Jim and why you feel we could help them?"

This does two things:

1. It gets your client more invested in the referral
2. It gives you valuable information for your initial contact

## Setting Up the Introduction

Here's where many consultants drop the ball. Don't just take the contact info and run. Ask:

"Do you feel like you should communicate to him first that I would be calling? Would that help him more so he's not caught off guard?"

This approach:

- Increases the likelihood of a warm reception
- Shows respect for both your client and the referral
- Sets you up for a more productive first conversation

## Guiding the Introduction

Once they agree to make the introduction, ask:

"What do you think you should say to him when you call?"

This allows you to:

- Ensure the right message is conveyed
- Prevent any misconceptions or overselling
- Guide the narrative about your consulting services

## The Follow-Up Call

When you finally call the referral, avoid the common pitfall of assuming they're ready to engage. Instead, try something like this:

"Hi Jim, it's Barry Gold. Amy suggested I call you as we recently helped her with XYZ, which was causing them ABC. She mentioned you might be experiencing some similar challenges. Is this an appropriate time to chat?"

This approach:

- Establishes your connection and credibility
- Focuses on potential problems, not your solution
- Respects their time and schedule

## The In-Person Meeting

If you're meeting in person, start with:

"Amy, it's nice meeting you. Let's do this: Just so I don't go over things you've already discussed with Jim, perhaps you could give me your thoughts on what you guys have talked about and what you'd like to cover. Would that help?"

This:

- Puts the ball in their court
- Avoids redundancy
- Shows you value their time and perspective

## Wrapping Up

Mastering referrals is about more than just getting introductions. It's about handling those introductions in a way that builds trust, avoids resistance, and positions you as a problem-solver rather than just another consultant.

Remember:

1. Time your ask right
2. Get the client to articulate your value
3. Ask for specific referrals based on problems you've solved
4. Guide the introduction process
5. Approach new referrals with respect and focus on their potential challenges

By implementing these strategies, you'll find that your referral meetings become more productive, more comfortable, and ultimately, more successful.
