# Living My Best Life: A $20 Million Daydream

I\'ve been playing a little thought experiment lately: If I had $20 million in the bank, how would I want to live my life? It\'s not about the money per se, but about imagining a life where financial constraints aren\'t the primary driver of my decisions. Here\'s what I\'ve come up with.

## Work: Finding the Sweet Spot

With financial freedom, I'd aim for a work schedule that balances productivity and passion:

- 2-3 days a week of focused work
- Flexibility to pursue projects I'm truly excited about
- Time for creative exploration and learning

The goal isn't to stop working, but to work on things that truly matter to me, still enjoy learning and teaching.

## Living Space: A Home That Inspires

My dream home would be a space that nurtures creativity and relaxation:

- Spacious, with plenty of room for hosting friends
- A dedicated home office for those work days
- A killer outdoor setup for grilling and chilling
- A pool for daily swims and relaxation
- High-end audio system for immersive music experiences
- Iconic furniture pieces like an Eames chair and Noguchi lamps

It's not just about luxury, but about creating an environment that fuels my passions and supports my lifestyle.

## Activities: Pursuing Passions

With more time and resources, I'd dive deeper into the activities that bring me joy:

### Pottery

- Regular sessions to hone my craft
- Potentially pursuing an apprenticeship or hosting a show
- Exploring hand-building techniques
- Creating functional art, like fish-serving plates

### Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

- Low-intensity training 2-3 times a week
- Focus on technique and enjoyment rather than competition
- Staying injury-free and maintaining fitness

### Swimming and Spearfishing

- Daily swims in my home pool for fitness
- Occasional spearfishing trips to connect with nature
- Learning to prepare the fish I catch

## Travel: Expanding Horizons

With financial freedom, I'd approach travel more intentionally:

- Quarterly cross-country trips (2 weeks each)
- Annual international trip to Europe or Japan
- Two freediving trips per year, possibly swimming with whales or orcas

The key is balancing adventure with my home-based passions and work commitments.

## Lifestyle: Quality Over Quantity

Money can't buy happiness, but it can certainly improve quality of life:

- High-quality, varied meals (possibly with a personal chef)
- Regular entertainment (monthly jazz or comedy shows)
- Hosting friends for dinners and gatherings
- House cleaner and personal assistant for support

The goal is to create a life rich in experiences and connections, not just possessions.

## Personal Growth: Never Stop Learning

Even with financial security, I'd continue investing in myself:

- Educating myself on investing and financial management
- Being more selective with commitments and relationships
- Focusing on "hell yes" experiences and friendships
- Writing more, both for personal growth and to share insights

## Reflections on This Exercise

This thought experiment isn't about daydreaming of wealth. It's about understanding what truly matters to me and how I can start incorporating elements of this ideal life into my current reality.

Some key takeaways:

1. Balance is crucial - even with unlimited resources, I'd want a mix of work, play, and personal growth.
2. Experiences and relationships matter more than possessions.
3. Health and wellness are non-negotiable, regardless of wealth.
4. Creativity and learning remain central to my ideal life.

While I may not have $20 million, this exercise has clarified my priorities and given me a roadmap for the life I want to create. It's a reminder that many aspects of our "ideal" life are within reach if we're intentional about our choices.

What would your $20 million life look like? More importantly, what elements of that life can you start incorporating today?
