# Context Engineering Series: Building Better Agentic RAG Systems

I've been helping companies build agentic RAG systems and studying coding agents from Cognition, Claude Code, Cursor, and others. These coding agents are probably unlocking a trillion-dollar industry—making them the most economically viable agents to date.

This series shares what I've learned from these teams and conversations with professional developers using these systems daily, exploring what we can apply to other industries.

## What is Context Engineering?

We've moved far beyond prompt engineering. Now we're designing portfolios of tools (directory listing, file editing, web search), slash commands like `/pr-create` that inject prompts vs , specialized sub-agents `@pr-creation-agent`, vs having an `AGENT.md` with systems that work across IDEs, command lines, GitHub, and Slack.

Context engineering is designing tool responses and interaction patterns that give agents situational awareness to navigate complex information spaces effectively.

To understand what this means practically, let's look at how systems have evolved:

**Before:** We precomputed what chunks needed to be put into context, injected them, and then asked the system to reason about the chunks. Search was a one-shot operation—you got your top-k results and that was it.

```python
def search(query: str, n_chunks: int = 10) -> list[str]:
    """Return raw text chunks, no metadata."""
    chunks = vector_search(query, top_k=n_chunks)
    return [chunk.text for chunk in chunks]

# One-shot RAG pattern
def answer_question(question: str) -> str:
    chunks = search(question)
    context = "\n".join(chunks)
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions about the context."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}"}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

**Now:** Agents are incredibly easy to build because all you need is a messages array and a bunch of tools. They're persistent, make multiple tool calls, and build understanding across conversations. They don't just need the right chunk—they need to understand the landscape of available information.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SearchTool(BaseModel):
    """Search with metadata and facets for strategic exploration."""
    query: str
    n_chunks: int = 10
    
    def run(self) -> dict:
        results = vector_search(self.query, top_k=self.n_chunks)
        return {
            chunk.id: chunk.text for chunk in results
        }

# Agent loop - persistent conversation with tool execution
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Use search strategically to explore information landscapes."}
]

while True:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=messages,
        tools=[SearchTool]
    )
    
    if response.tool_calls:
        # Execute tools and add results to conversation
        for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
            result = SearchTool(**tool_call.args).run()
            messages.append({"role": "tool", "content": str(result), "tool_call_id": tool_call.id})
    else:
        # Agent has final answer
        break
```

!!! tip "How Easy Are Agents to Build?"
    Coding agents have become remarkably simple to implement. Check out [How to Build an Agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) - if you give a coding agent literally just this blog post, it will write a coding agent for you. The barrier to entry has never been lower.

The fundamental shift is this: **agents don't just consume information, they explore information spaces**. Context engineering is about designing systems that support this exploration—giving agents not just the right data, but the right understanding of what data exists and how to navigate it.

## What This Series Covers

This series explores practical approaches to context engineering across different domains and use cases. The focus is on implementation strategies, real-world examples, and measurable business outcomes from companies making this transition.

**Topics include:**

- Moving beyond chunks to structured information landscapes
- Multi-level response architectures that provide navigational context
- Agent-friendly data organization patterns
- Performance optimization for agentic workloads
- Business metrics and ROI measurement strategies

**Start Here:** [Beyond Chunks: Why Context Engineering is the Future of RAG](./facets-context-engineering/) - The foundational piece that establishes the four-level framework and demonstrates why tool response structure matters as much as content.

## Who This Series Is For

- **Engineering teams** building agentic RAG systems
- **Product leaders** evaluating the ROI of agent implementations  
- **AI researchers** interested in tool design and agent cognition
- **Anyone** curious about how agents actually work with structured data

Each post includes practical code examples, implementation strategies, and real business metrics from companies that have made this transition.

## Getting Started

Start with the foundational post [Beyond Chunks: Why Context Engineering is the Future of RAG](./context-engineering-tool-response.md) to understand the core thesis and four-level framework. From there, you can either read sequentially or jump to specific topics based on your current implementation needs.

The future of RAG isn't about better embeddings or larger context windows—it's about teaching agents to navigate information spaces systematically. Let's explore how to build that future together.
