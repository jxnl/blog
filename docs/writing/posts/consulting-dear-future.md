# Dear Future AI Consultant

Picture this: Four AI engineers walk out of some big tech office, maybe its layoffs, or burn out, or the golden handcuffs, but they're finally free. Fast forward one year, and their paths couldn't be more different.

- Engineer 1 went the traditional freelance route. He's making $300 an hour, meticulously tracking every minute, and constantly hearing he's "too expensive." Yet, he's always scrambling for the next gig.

- Engineer 2 dove into the startup world. She's now a VC-backed founder, drowning in pitch decks and investor meetings. Sure, the TechCrunch headlines are nice, but she hasn't had a good night's sleep in months, constantly worrying about runway and growth metrics.

- Engineer 3 became an indie hacker. He's over the moon about hitting $2,000 in Monthly Recurring Revenue with his AI product. It's a great start, but he's realizing that building the product was just the beginning. Now he's grappling with the challenges of distribution and marketing, discovering that these skills are just as crucial as his technical expertise.

- And then there's me, Engineer 4. I'm writing this from a business class seat on my way to San Francisco, closing a six-figure deal with a client. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.

As an AI consultant, I've built a personal brand, grown an audience, and mastered marketing and distribution - all while confidently selling my expertise. I've made friends with VCs, hosted dinners for industry leaders, and built a network that spans the tech world.

The best part? I've got $500K sitting in my business account, deployed 100k in angel investments and have paid my friends 100s of 1000s of dollars to work together and on projects we love. If I ever decide to start a company, raise money, or build a product, I've already developed all the skills I need - plus the cash to get started.

## What Made The Difference?

It wasn't talent or hard work. We're all putting in the hours. The difference was in how we chose to leverage our AI skills in this booming market.

That's why I created the "Indie AI Consultant" newsletter. In just 10 days I share one email with you, the reader. It's packed with insights and strategies that I've learned from my own experience.

About those four AI engineers I mentioned earlier: we all had the same starting point, but our paths diverged dramatically. The difference? Knowledge about how to turn AI skills into a profitable consulting business that offers both freedom and financial success.

I can't promise you'll be flying business class next month if you join. But I can guarantee you'll find it packed with actionable insights to launch your consulting career - and potentially never worry about hourly rates, investor pressure, or how to price your services ever again.

Just enter your email below to get started, you'll get an email from me every 10 days or so, and I'll see you on the inside.
