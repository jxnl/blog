# What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that **enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them with external knowledge sources**. In essence, RAG combines the generative power of LLMs with the vast information stored in databases, documents, and other repositories. This approach enables LLMs to generate more accurate, relevant, and contextually grounded responses.

## Why Use RAG?

LLMs, while impressive in their language processing abilities, often suffer from limitations such as:

- **Hallucinations:** Generating incorrect or nonsensical information.
- **Lack of Factual Grounding:** Providing responses not anchored in real-world knowledge.
- **Inability to Access Updated Information:** LLMs are trained on static datasets and cannot access information updated after their training period.

**RAG addresses these limitations by providing LLMs with a mechanism to access and incorporate external information**. Instead of solely relying on the knowledge encoded during training, RAG allows LLMs to:

1. **Retrieve relevant information** from external sources based on a user's query.
2. **Use the retrieved information** as context for generating a response.

## Key Components of a RAG System

A typical RAG system consists of several components working together:

- **Knowledge Base:** This is the external source of information that the RAG system will draw upon. It can be a database, a collection of documents, a knowledge graph, or any other structured or unstructured data repository.
- **Retrieval Model:** This component is responsible for selecting the most relevant information from the knowledge base, given a user's query. Common retrieval models include keyword-based search (like BM25), semantic search using embeddings, or a combination of both.
- **Language Model (LLM):** The LLM is the heart of the RAG system, tasked with generating the final response. It takes the user's query and the information retrieved from the knowledge base as input.
- **Re-ranker (Optional):** A re-ranker is often used to refine the initial retrieval results, ensuring that the most relevant information is passed to the LLM.
- **Query Understanding (Optional):** This component goes beyond simple keyword matching. It tries to interpret the user's intent and potentially rewrites the query for more effective retrieval. For instance, it might extract dates, locations, or other entities from a query to refine the search. Learn more about query understanding in my post [RAG is more than embeddings](./rag.md).

## Benefits of Using RAG

The sources highlight numerous benefits of incorporating RAG into LLM-based applications:

- **Improved Accuracy and Relevance:** By accessing and incorporating relevant external information, RAG helps LLMs generate more accurate and factual responses.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users receive more informative and trustworthy answers, leading to a better overall experience.
- **Addressing Complex Queries:** RAG allows for the handling of queries that require specific domain knowledge or access to up-to-date information.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** RAG systems can be easily scaled by adding more data to the knowledge base. They can also be adapted to different domains by tailoring the knowledge base and retrieval models.
- **Continuous Improvement:** RAG systems are designed for iterative development. By monitoring user feedback, analyzing retrieval metrics (like precision and recall), and refining the system's components, you can achieve continuous improvement.

## Building and Improving a RAG System

The sources offer a comprehensive "RAG Playbook" and guidance on systematically developing and enhancing RAG systems. You can explore this in detail in my [RAG improvement guide](./rag-improving-rag.md) and [RAG flywheel strategy](./rag-flywheel.md). Key insights include:

- **Start with Synthetic Data:** Before deploying to real users, generate synthetic queries and test your retrieval model. This establishes a baseline and allows for rapid iteration. See my guide on [low-hanging fruit in RAG](./rag-low-hanging-fruit.md) for practical tips.
- **Focus on Leading Metrics:** Monitor metrics like retrieval precision, recall, and the number of retrieval experiments conducted. These metrics provide early indicators of system performance. For a complete evaluation framework, see [the only 6 RAG evaluations you need](./rag-only-6-evals.md).
- **Collect Real-World Data:** As you gain real user data, analyze queries and cluster them into topics and capability categories. This identifies areas for improvement. I explain this in detail in my posts on [RAG decomposition](./rag-decomposition.md) and [topics and capabilities](./topics_and_capabilities.md).
- **Utilize Metadata:** Extract and leverage document metadata (dates, authors, tags, etc.) for better filtering and retrieval.
- **Combine Search Methods:** Use both full-text search (like BM25) and semantic search (embeddings) for more robust retrieval.
- **Implement User Feedback:** Provide clear feedback mechanisms for users to rate the system's responses. Analyze this feedback to identify weaknesses.
- **Continuously Experiment:** Test different embedding models, re-ranking methods, and query rewriting techniques to optimize your system.

## Beyond Question Answering

While RAG has often been used for question answering, the sources predict a shift towards report generation. This evolution stems from the observation that reports provide more value than simple answers. I explore this future direction in [RAG++: The future of RAG](./rag-plusplus.md):

- **Decision Making:** Reports help users analyze information and make better decisions.
- **Resource Allocation:** Reports guide businesses in allocating resources more effectively.
- **Standardized Processes:** Reports can be structured using standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistency and scalability.

The sources suggest that RAG-powered report generation will open up new possibilities, including a marketplace of report templates tailored to specific needs.

## Challenges in Building RAG Systems

While RAG offers significant advantages, there are also challenges to consider:

- **Data Quality and Management:** Building and maintaining a high-quality knowledge base is crucial. Issues like data inconsistency, incompleteness, and bias can negatively impact system performance.
- **Resource Intensity:** Training and fine-tuning embedding models and LLMs can be computationally expensive and require significant resources.
- **Complexity:** Designing effective retrieval models, query understanding components, and re-rankers can be complex, requiring expertise in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. To understand the different levels of complexity, see my guide on [levels of RAG complexity](./rag-levels-of-rag.md).

## Conclusion

RAG represents a powerful approach to combining the strengths of LLMs and external knowledge sources. By carefully designing and implementing the components of a RAG system, you can build applications that deliver more accurate, relevant, and useful information to users. The continuous improvement cycle, driven by data analysis, feedback, and experimentation, ensures that RAG systems evolve and become more sophisticated over time. As the field of RAG continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative applications that transform the way we interact with information.
