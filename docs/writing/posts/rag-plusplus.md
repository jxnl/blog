# Predictions for the Future of RAG

In the next 6 to 8 months, RAG will be used primarily for report generation. We'll see a shift from using RAG agents as question-answering systems to using them more as report-generation systems. This is because the value you can get from a report is much greater than the current RAG systems in use. I'll explain this by discussing what I've learned as a consultant about understanding value and then how I think companies should describe the value they deliver through RAG.

Rag is the feature, not the benefit.

## Reports over RAG

So why are reports better than RAG? Simply put, RAG systems suck because the value you derive is time saved from finding an answer. This is a one-dimensional value, and it's very hard to sell any value beyond that. Meanwhile, a report is a higher-value product because it is a decision-making tool that enables better resource allocation.

To better illustrate this, I'll give a couple of examples: 

If I have one employee I'm paying hourly, they can use a RAG app to run a query, and then they can deliver an answer. This is a perfectly acceptable way of using RAG in one-dimensional static scenarios, such as asking single questions. However, when a research team wants to do interviews (question-answer queries), the deliverable isn't an answer to a set of questions. Instead, it's a report. So, the RAG app can save the time of 8 employees making 50 dollars an hour, whereas the report will cost $20,000. If the report is helping an executive allocate a 5million dollar budget, the price might charge becomes a much smaller portion of that investment? This is true even if the process to generate the report is just a RAG application in a for loop.

The value of these two items is communicated differently. RAG is evaluated as a percentage of wages, while the report is evaluated as a percentage of high-leverage outcomes.

Another way this plays out is if you're hiring. If you're interviewing a client with 6 rounds of interviews, you could use RAG to ask questions, which might work. What might be better is if your organization made a well-defined template on which you can make high-value decisions. Something like "Has this candidate worked in a team before", "Are they independent?", "Do they reflect our company's values?". These are pretty well-known and established parts of the hiring template.

If there were a service that could take this template and all the meeting notes from the six interviews and then generate a report for you and your team to review and utilize in your hiring process, the value would be derived from the decision-making and capital allocated to hire the candidate. A recruiter might take $40,000 on a $250,000 candidate, which means being able to make a better decision as a result of this hiring overview is enormous. The hypothetical hiring app's value is much greater than simple question-answer sets because the outcome of the RAG application is less clear than the outcome of having a high-quality report you can rely on to make key decisions for your business. This is because the end deliverable has a greater value that can be leveraged, even if the process is similar. A good interview panel knows what the question should be, but your hiring copilot should do more and help you get there.

## Why you need SOPs

Furthermore, how reports are written is incredibly important. Scaling decision-making and processes in a company often involves developing standard operating procedures (SOPs), which are a way of formatting various reports in a unified manner.

One of the reasons I attend workshops, get coaching, or read business books is because the outcome I am looking for is an SOP. For instance, I learned a way to write sales engagement letters that convert better. Now, all of my meetings fit this format and help make me far more money than the $40 dollar book I learned the template from cost. People are taught to give feedback and answer questions in specific ways. You get better outcomes when this output is structured correctly in something like a report or a template. Being able to pay for the right report template can be incredibly valuable because it ensures you're getting the outcome you actually need.

I don't care so much about being able to read a chat transcript of a meeting I had. I care if I can turn that transcript into a format and report that I know will drive my desired business outcomes rather than just save me time. I want the AI to create a memo with clear deliverables for me or summarize the chat transcript to tell me, "This is the objective, this is how we make the decision, and here are the follow-ups."

Ultimately, a report's value goes beyond a wage worker answering questions—it supports high-leverage outcomes like strategic decision-making.

## Future outcomes

If RAG primarily becomes report generation it means two things are possible: 1. a marketplace of report-generating tools, and 2. the ability to effectively find the right report for your desired outcome. I think that question-answer sets are going to be of limited usefulness, while report generation addresses not only question-answer sets but the value of decision-making. When these reports are available in a marketplace of templates, they add further value because understanding what the template is defining becomes a skill in itself. These are the kinds of skills that people then take workshops on, get coaches for, and buy books about.
