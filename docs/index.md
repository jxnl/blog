# :boom: What's up?

I'm an [independent consultant](./services.md), staff-level machine learning engineer, angel investor, startup advisor, and a16z scout. I write about open source, consulting, and how to systematically improve AI applications.

After years at top tech companies, RSI forced me to reinvent myself. Instead of writing code, I now teach teams to work more scientifically—measuring improvements, iterating quickly, and focusing on what truly matters.

I’ve helped dozens of teams adapt to AI’s rapid evolution. When I’m not consulting, I produce educational content and courses to help more engineers thrive in the changing AI landscape.

I'm also the creator of [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/), a popular Python library for structured outputs from LLMs, which was cited by the OpenAI team as inspiration for their `structured output` feature. We currently have over 8000 stars and 1M monthly downloads.

## Independent Consulting

I run a solo consulting practice focused on helping startups build better practises as many software companies transition to AI.

## Systematically Improve Your RAG (Enrollment Open)

Join our intensive [6 week certification](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md) starting February 2024 to systematically improve your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Learn how to build robust processes for identifying system bottlenecks, significantly enhance your probabilistic systems, and implement advanced RAG techniques for real-world applications.
