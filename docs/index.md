# Build AI Systems That Actually Work

I'm Jason Liu. I write about turning AI prototypes into production systems—measure improvements, iterate quickly, and ship reliably.

Creator of [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/) (12k+ stars, 6M+ downloads), the Python library OpenAI cited as inspiration for their structured outputs.

## Quick note

Previously I did consulting, expert calls, and cohort-based training. Those offerings are now closed.

If you want hands-on help, I recommend reaching out to my friend Nila: [nila.is](https://nila.is/). Please mention you came from me.
