# Jason Liu

Founder of [567 Studios](./services.md). Creator of [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/) (6M+ monthly downloads). Angel investor and a16z scout. Based in New York.

Previously Staff ML Engineer at Stitch Fix (2018-2023). RSI forced me to pivot from coding to teaching. Now I help teams work more scientifically: measuring improvements, iterating quickly, and focusing on what truly matters.

## What I Believe

- **Your AI problems aren't AI problems.** They're usually data, process, or people problems.
- **Sell outcomes, not tasks.** Measure what matters: does this solve a real problem someone will pay for?
- **Simplicity beats complexity.** If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.
- **Experimentation speed is your only moat.** Confidence is the memory of success; practice more than you play.

## Consulting

I help companies turn prototypes into production systems. No maintenance contracts. No dependencies. Just results.
