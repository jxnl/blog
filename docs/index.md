## What I Believe

- **Your AI problems aren't AI problems.** They're usually data, process, or people problems.
- **Sell outcomes, not tasks.** Measure what matters: does this solve a real problem someone will pay for?
- **Simplicity beats complexity.** If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.
- **Experimentation speed is your only moat.** Confidence is the memory of success; practice more than you play.

## Past Consulting Work

From 2023-2024, I worked with companies on turning prototypes into production systems. No maintenance contracts. No dependencies. Just results.

## Open Source

I created [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/), a Python library for structured outputs from LLMs. OpenAI cited it as inspiration for their `structured output` feature.
