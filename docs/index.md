# :boom: What's up?

I'm Jason Liu, staff-level machine learning engineer, angel investor, startup advisor, and a16z scout. I write about open source and how to systematically improve AI applications.

After years at top tech companies, RSI forced me to reinvent myself. Instead of writing code, I now focus on teaching teams to work more scientifically—measuring improvements, iterating quickly, and focusing on what truly matters.

I previously did consulting, expert calls, and cohort-based training. **Those offerings are now closed.**

If you want hands-on help, I recommend reaching out to my friend Nila: [nila.is](https://nila.is/). Please mention you came from me.

The best way to keep up with new posts is my newsletter:

I'm also the creator of [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/), a popular Python library for structured outputs from LLMs, which was cited by the OpenAI team as inspiration for their `structured output` feature.

## Independent Consulting (Closed)

Previously, I ran a solo consulting practice focused on helping startups as many software companies transitioned to AI.

## Systematically Improve Your RAG (Closed)

I previously ran a cohort-based RAG course. Enrollment is closed, but I’m keeping the material and posts up.
