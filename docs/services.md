# AI Consulting for Engineering Leaders

## I work with engineering leaders like you who:

* **Struggle to measure AI performance** - I help implement meaningful metrics beyond accuracy, focusing on business outcomes that matter to your users.

* **Need faster iteration cycles** - I accelerate your testing from weeks to days, enabling 3-5x faster experimentation and 20-40% improved metrics.

* **Lack AI expertise on their team** - As a former Stitch Fix ML engineer who's guided teams at HubSpot and Zapier, I provide hands-on training for engineering teams.

* **Want AI features that drive business value** - I help transform existing products into AI-enabled solutions that solve real user problems, not just showcase capabilities.

* **Need reliable AI systems** - I embed with your team to identify bottlenecks, implement robust feedback loops, and replace intuition with data-driven decisions.
