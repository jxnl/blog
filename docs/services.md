## Core Technical Capabilities

**Advanced Prompt Engineering & LLM Optimization**
Systematic approaches to prompt design, evaluation, and optimization for production systems. Build reliable, consistent outputs from language models at scale.

**Rapid Prototyping & Validation**
Turn AI concepts into working prototypes in days, not weeks. Validate technical feasibility and business impact before committing to full development cycles.

**Agent Systems Architecture**
Design and implement autonomous AI workflows that handle complex, multi-step processes. From simple task automation to sophisticated reasoning systems.

**Document Extraction & Processing**
Build robust pipelines that transform unstructured documents into structured, actionable data. Handle edge cases and maintain accuracy at scale.

**Hands-on Skills Transfer**
Pair programming sessions and intensive training that builds permanent AI capabilities in your team. No black boxes - your engineers learn to own and extend the systems.

**Systematic Experimentation**
Establish frameworks for continuous AI improvement. Design experiments, measure impact, and systematically optimize your AI applications for business outcomes.

**Strategic Content & Positioning**
Leverage AI expertise for growth and developer relations. Define clear value propositions, create compelling technical content, and build market credibility.

## I'm not a consultant trying to change recurring revenue over impact.

You deserve a partner who builds independence, not dependencies. You're not looking for another tool or framework - you need better processes that stick. You want methods to experiment faster and systematically improve your team, processes, and applications that drive real business outcomes.

You shouldn't have to deal with consultants who chase recurring revenue or sell maintenance contracts - these create perverse incentives. Instead, you get a partner who works alongside your team, transfers knowledge, and builds capabilities. When our engagement ends, you'll have:

- **Continuous improvement processes** - Establish feedback loops that transform user interactions into measurable product enhancements
- **Accelerated experimentation cycles** - Transform weeks of testing into days, enabling 3-5x faster product iteration
- **Data-driven prioritization framework** - Replace intuition with systematic methods to identify the highest-impact AI opportunities
