# Applied AI Consulting Services


I'm not your typical consultant. For better or for worse, I've been in the trenches more than I'd like, and my goal is to help you minimize regret by sharing my lessons with you and giving you a clear vision on what to invest in and what to build.

I have worked with leading companies on AI products such as [Limitless AI](http://limitless.ai/), [Sandbar](https://sandbar.inc/), [Raycast](https://raycast.com/), [Tensorlake](https://tensorlake.ai/), [Dunbar](https://trydunbar.com/), [Bytebot](https://bytebot.ai/), [Naro](http://narohq.com/), [Trunk Tools](https://trunktools.com/), [New Computer](http://new.computer/), [Kay.ai](http://kay.ai/), [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), [Pydantic](http://pydantic.dev/), and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

??? note "More Background"

    - Led feasibility research and integrated AI models like VAE-GAN and GPT-3, boosting revenue by $50M.

    - Oversaw a $400,000 budget for impactful AI data curation.

    - Over three years, I spearheaded the creation of a robust recommendation [framework](./writing/posts/recsys-frameworks.md) and observability tools, handling 350 million daily requests.

    Throughout my career in the tech industry, I've had the privilege of working with both established organizations such as [Stitchfix](https://www.stitchfix.com/), [Meta](https://about.fb.com/), and [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/), as well as startups including [Rewind AI](https://rewind.ai/), [Naro](https://narohq.com/), [Trunk Tools](https://trunktools.com/), [New Computer](https://newcomputer.io/), [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

    In these collaborations, I've tackled diverse areas including personalization, search, data generation and management, sales, marketing, infrastructure, finance, and agent-based modeling.

## Problems I Solve

My expertise includes retrieval-augmented generation, query understanding, prompt engineering, embedding finetuning, and MLOps observability.
