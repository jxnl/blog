# AI Consulting for Engineering Leaders

## I turn great engineers into great AI engineers

I work directly with engineering leaders who want to transform their talented teams without replacing them. Having worked with AI for over a decade, I've developed frameworks that help teams achieve measurable improvements in just 2-3 months.

I don't build dependencies - I build capabilities.

## I'm not a consultant trying to change recurring revenue over impact.

You don't want to have a long-term dependency on me, I get it. I'm not here to pitch you on tools and frameworks but rather better processes. I'm here to teach you methods to experiment faster and systematically improve your team, your processes and ultimately applications that drive business outcomes.

I don't chase recurring revenue or sell maintenance contracts - I believe that creates perverse incentives. Instead, I work alongside your team, transfer knowledge, and build capabilities so that when I leave, you have:

* **Continuous improvement processes** - Establish feedback loops that transform user interactions into measurable product enhancements
* **Accelerated experimentation cycles** - Transform weeks of testing into days, enabling 3-5x faster product iteration
* **Data-driven prioritization framework** - Replace intuition with systematic methods to identify the highest-impact AI opportunities
