# AI Consulting (Past Work)

**This service is no longer available.**

From 2023-2024, I helped companies turn prototypes into production systems, with a focus on transforming great engineers into great AI engineers. The work delivered measurable improvements across evaluation frameworks, agent systems, and systematic experimentation.

If you're looking for hands-on learning, check out my [RAG course](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md) where 1000+ engineers have learned to build production systems.

**1000+** engineers trained | **6M+** monthly downloads (Instructor) | **11k+** GitHub stars

## What I Do

**Rapid Prototyping & Validation**
Turn AI concepts into working prototypes in days, not weeks. Validate technical feasibility and business impact before committing to full development.

**Agent Systems Architecture**
Design autonomous AI workflows that handle complex, multi-step processes. From simple automation to sophisticated reasoning systems.

**Document Extraction & Processing**
Build robust pipelines that transform unstructured documents into structured data. Handle edge cases and maintain accuracy at scale.

**Systematic Experimentation**
Establish frameworks for continuous improvement. Design experiments, measure impact, and optimize AI applications for business outcomes.

**Hands-on Skills Transfer**
Pair programming and intensive training that builds permanent capabilities. Your engineers learn to own and extend the systems.

## What You Get

You get independence, not dependencies. You get capabilities, not ongoing contracts.

When our engagement ends, you'll have:

- **Continuous improvement processes** - Feedback loops that transform user interactions into measurable enhancements
- **Accelerated experimentation cycles** - Transform weeks of testing into days, enabling 3-5x faster iteration
- **Data-driven prioritization** - Systematic methods to identify the highest-impact opportunities
