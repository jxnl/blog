# Availability

Previously, I did independent consulting, expert calls, and cohort-based training.

**I’m no longer taking consulting engagements, expert calls, or course enrollments.**

## What I still do

- **Investing**: see [Investments](./investments.md).
- **Occasional advisory roles**: I rarely take these. If it’s a strong fit (long-term, high-leverage, clear scope), you can email `work@jxnl.co` with a short note.

## Previously

Some teams I’ve worked with (historical): Zapier, HubSpot, Weights & Biases, Modal, Timescale, Pydantic, and others.

If you’re looking for material in the same spirit, start with [Writing](./writing/index.md).
