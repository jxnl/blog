# AI Consulting for Engineering Leaders

## I work with engineering leaders like you who:

* **Struggle to measure AI performance** - I help implement meaningful metrics beyond accuracy, focusing on business outcomes that matter to your users.

* **Need faster iteration cycles** - I accelerate your testing from weeks to days, enabling 3-5x faster experimentation and 20-40% improved metrics.

* **Lack AI expertise on their team** - As a former Stitch Fix ML engineer who's guided teams at HubSpot and Zapier, I provide hands-on training for engineering teams.

* **Want AI features that drive business value** - I help transform existing products into AI-enabled solutions that solve real user problems, not just showcase capabilities.

* **Need reliable AI systems** - I embed with your team to identify bottlenecks, implement robust feedback loops, and replace intuition with data-driven decisions.

## I'm not a consultant trying to change recurring revenue over impact.

You don't want to have a long-term dependency on me, I get it. I'm not here to pitch you on tools and frameworks but rather better processes. I'm here to teach you methods to experiment faster and systematically improve your team, your processes and ultimately applications that drive business outcomes.

I don't chase recurring revenue or sell maintenance contracts - I believe that creates perverse incentives. Instead, I work alongside your team, transfer knowledge, and build capabilities so that when I leave, you have:

* **Continuous improvement processes** - Establish feedback loops that transform user interactions into measurable product enhancements
* **Accelerated experimentation cycles** - Transform weeks of testing into days, enabling 3-5x faster product iteration
* **Data-driven prioritization framework** - Replace intuition with systematic methods to identify the highest-impact AI opportunities 

I often help upskill your existing team, help you hire AI engineers, and onboard them before we sunset our engagement - ensuring a smooth transition and lasting impact.
