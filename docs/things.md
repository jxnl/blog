# Things

*Some links may include affiliate attribution. Recommendations are based on personal use.*

In the past 2 decades I went from sharing a bed with my parents renting out the unfinished basement of some Canadian family to doing quite well for myself. This is all the stuff I use, plan to use, and what's on my upgrade roadmap. Each item includes why it works for me.

## Sleep

I really miss my own bed after traveling so much, but I've always stuck with **Purple Mattress** — everyone's going for 8 Sleep, but I don't want to shell out for a subscription just to sleep. For better breathing, **[Nasal Strips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XF91NZ4)** help me breathe easier (not into mouth taping yet). **Allergen-proof bedding** keeps dust mites at bay. With long hair now, **[silk pillowcases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7GRYXLS)** prevent tangles and breakage.

For darkness: **[door light blockers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D4QHRC7W?th=1)** and **[blackout blinds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MZLSMHM)**. For travel, **[Manta Sleep eye mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask)** — they have hot and cold versions which I love.

I've been building better morning habits: getting outside first thing for coffee and sunlight exposure, eating dinner earlier. Still working on reducing pre-bedtime screen time.

---

## Air Quality

Large part of my poor sleep comes from allergies and air quality, so it's useful to get an **[air quality monitor](https://www.airgradient.com/)**, **[air purifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01728NLRG/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)**, and humidifier during winter.

---

## Personal Care

I usually shower with just water, but recently started using skincare products. **[CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7HHKH3G)** — lightweight moisturizer with ceramides and hyaluronic acid. After a week, I received compliments on my skin. For supplements: **[NAD+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK5K5TQ)** and **[Tongkat Ali](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TTDFXFV)** support overall hormone health.

**[Aesop Reverence hand wash](https://www.aesop.com/us/p/body/hand/reverence-aromatique-hand-wash/)** — exfoliating with wonderful scent. **[Hinoki from Monocle](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/everything-else/product/comme-des-garcons-parfums/monocle-edition-scent-one-hinoki-eau-de-toilette-50-ml/6659441)** — woody, mossy scent inspired by Kyoto.

Planning to start **[retinol](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D2C4Q4/ref=ewc_pr_img_4?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)** for better skin.

### On My Roadmap
- Collagen peptides
- Fish oil  
- Magnesium
- Glucosamine & chondroitin
- Electrolyte protocols

**What these ingredients do:**

- **Retinol** — Vitamin A that accelerates skin cell renewal, reduces wrinkles, fades dark spots
- **Ceramides** — Natural fats that strengthen skin barrier and prevent moisture loss
- **NAD+** — Coenzyme for cellular energy and mitochondrial function  
- **Tongkat Ali** — Southeast Asian herb for energy, mood, and hormone balance
- **Collagen Peptides** — Improves skin elasticity, stronger nails and hair
- **Fish Oil** — Omega-3s for brain function and reduced inflammation
- **Magnesium** — Essential mineral for energy, sleep, and stress reduction
- **Glucosamine & Chondroitin** — Joint health and cartilage support

### Teeth and Oral Health

**[Nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083JHCCV2)** (n-HA) — biocompatible material that remineralizes tooth enamel. It's the same mineral that naturally makes up our tooth enamel.

---

## Hair Care

With long, permed hair, moisture retention is everything. **[Milbon Curl Mousse](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086JTYR1G)** keeps curls hydrated and defined. Planning to add hair oils and invest in a **[Mason Pearson brush](https://www.amazon.com/Mason-Pearson-Popular-Mixture-Bristle/dp/B001N444JK)**.

> **The Science:** Perms chemically break and reform hair's natural bonds, making hair more porous. Hair absorbs moisture quickly but loses it fast. Without regular hydration, permed hair becomes straight, frizzy, and brittle.

### On My Roadmap
- High-quality hair dryer
- Hair oils for moisture retention

---

## Audio

Relatively speaking, my tech is pretty basic: MacBook Pro and iPhone. **[Audio-Technica record player](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N3S4X3P)** with **[Edifier speakers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088685QVJ)**. I connect an Amazon Echo to my **[Harman Kardon Aura Studio 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086FS4BSV)** — the single best speaker I've ever owned, perfect for hosting parties.

### On My Roadmap
- Level up audio setup (still deciding what I'd use it for)
- AirPods Pro

---

## Office

**[Herman Miller Embody chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/)** and **[Kinesis Advantage 360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/)** keyboard. **[Eames lounge chair and ottoman](https://www.eamesoffice.com/products/lounge-chair-and-ottoman)** from Eames Office.

**[Multiple charging stations](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN8C3MDQ)** where I can charge battery packs to take on the go.

### Ergonomics & Eye Health

- Your body tells you when something's wrong — listen to it
- Good equipment pays off (hence the Herman Miller and Kinesis choices)  
- Movement is key — shift positions throughout the day
- Proper monitor height matters (eyes align with top third)

---

## Lighting

Passive ambient lighting is key. **Philips Hue lights** and **[Noguchi lamps](https://shop.noguchi.org/collections/akari-light-sculptures)** — pricey but I love them.

> It's funny how a simple switch from ceiling-mounted lights to the soft scatter of floor lamps can transform your home from "just another workspace" into a cozy cave of creativity.

---

## Storage

**[Muji storage](https://www.muji.us/collections/storage-organizers?srsltid=AfmBOoqMRarrbP1eRCeWDj_Qx6XfFzLqcCSFLNUw7R7_76XsnNbxAQTL)** for organization.

### Grail Item
**USM Haller storage** — long-term investment worth saving for.

---

## Traveling

**[Rimowa luggage](https://www.rimowa.com)** with **[Amazon packing cubes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014VBI5MS)**. 

I genuinely hate traveling, but a few nice things make it bearable: **[Manta sleep mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask)** and bringing hydrating face and hair products because airplane air is so dry.

---

## Fashion

**Wyatt harness boots** — the uniform that never ages. Black, resolable, built to last. Get them resoled right after purchase. I've worn my **[Wyatt harness boots](https://www.ysl.com/en-us/pr/wyatt-harness-boots-in-smooth-leather-810162485.html)** for years and they're still pristine.

**[Cargo pants](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/nanamica/khaki-straight-cut-cargo-pants/16372621)** made from CORDURA. **[Ten Thousand](https://www.tenthousand.com/)** for shirts.

**[Clothing steamer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V91437Y)** — wrinkly clothes are not it.

### Yohji Yamamoto — the philosophy

My favorite brand is **[Yohji Yamamoto](https://www.theshopyohjiyamamoto.com/)**. His signature style combines Japanese design with European techniques, focusing on innovative draping and materials. Asymmetrical cuts and predominantly black palette, influenced by watching his mother work with fabrics in their small shop.

One good Yohji piece annihilates three seasons of hype drops. Buy once, hem to your proportions, and you'll look like you care about form and have better things to do than chase trends.

The trick: find a couple good brands that work for your body type, then stick with them as you learn about your proportions.

---

## Kitchen

**Essential tools:**
- **Good knife** — I'm Chinese about this. I only use a vegetable cleaver for every function
- **Epicurean cutting board** 
- **Rice cooker**
- **Good blender**

---

## Services

I'm constantly buying my time back. First hire: EA, then cleaners, then chef. Still looking for a meal prep chef who could come to my house and cook once a week.

- **Laundry & Cleaning Service** — save time, maintain tidy space
- **Massage Therapy (bi-monthly)** — stay loose, reduce stress  
- **Concierge Medical & Personal Chef** — focus on lean body goals, specialized care
- **EA Support** — manage appointments, organize travel, optimize calendar
