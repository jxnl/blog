I work with fast-growing startups who are looking to invest in their applied AI work. If you're interested in working together please take a look at my [services page](services.md) or book an [expert call](https://cal.com/jasonliu/expert-call). Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:jason+work@jxnl.co) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/jxnlco). I'm currently fully booked until May 2024.

If you have general questions for trying something new, just [make an issue](https://github.com/jxnl/blog/issues) and tag it with 'question'. I'll try to answer it in a blog post.

I'm also available for speaking engagements. If you're interested in having me speak at your event or podcast, please reach out via [email](mailto:jason+speaking@jxnl.co) as well.
