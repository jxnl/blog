# Workshops - AGENTS.md

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive workshop series for building self-improving RAG systems. The workshops guide readers through transforming RAG from static technical implementation into continuously evolving products that improve through user feedback and data-driven enhancement.

## File Structure

- **Chapter 0**: Introduction to product mindset for RAG systems
- **Chapter 1**: Kickstarting data flywheel with synthetic data
- **Chapter 2**: From evaluation to product enhancement
- **Chapter 3**: User experience design (3 parts)
- **Chapter 4**: Topic modeling and query understanding (2 parts)
- **Chapter 5**: Multimodal and structured data (2 parts)
- **Chapter 6**: Architecture and product integration (3 parts)

## Content Standards

- **YAML frontmatter**: title, description metadata for each chapter
- **Progressive learning**: Each chapter builds on previous concepts
- **Practical implementation**: Code examples and hands-on exercises
- **Case studies**: Real-world examples with specific metrics
- **The RAG Flywheel**: Measure → Analyze → Improve → Iterate methodology

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Product mindset**: Treating RAG as evolving product, not static implementation
- **Evaluation frameworks**: Precision, recall, leading vs lagging metrics
- **Synthetic data generation**: Chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting
- **Embedding fine-tuning**: Custom models for specific domains
- **User feedback collection**: UX patterns for continuous improvement
- **Query understanding**: BERTopic for pattern analysis
- **Multimodal integration**: Documents, images, structured data
- **Architecture patterns**: Intelligent routing and tool integration

## Writing Style

- **Educational focus**: Clear explanations at 9th-grade reading level
- **Systematic approach**: Data-driven improvement over ad-hoc tweaking
- **Practical application**: Real datasets and production considerations
- **Quantitative results**: Specific performance improvements (e.g., 50% to 90% recall)
- **Actionable insights**: Concrete steps and implementation guidance

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these workshops, readers will:

- Understand the improvement flywheel for RAG systems
- Build evaluation frameworks that run continuously
- Create synthetic data for cold-start problems
- Implement fine-tuning strategies for embeddings
- Design user feedback collection systems
- Analyze query patterns for optimization opportunities
- Integrate multimodal data effectively
- Build production-ready RAG architectures
