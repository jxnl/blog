## Executive Summary

I'm a former Staff MLE who built a 7-figure AI business following a hand injury. I created Instructor (3M+ monthly downloads) and I'm AI-native with experience spanning model training, information retrieval, observability, context engineering, agent development, training, content creation, marketing, and sales. I'm also an angel investor (a16z Scout) and I'm looking for my next 4-5 year project to apply my technical and business expertise.
