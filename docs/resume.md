## Executive Summary

I'm a former Staff MLE who built a 7-figure AI business by bridging the gap between research, product, and customers. I created Instructor (3M+ monthly downloads) and have spent 10+ years building AI systems at scale while training 1000+ practitioners. I help companies establish thought leadership in agent engineering, build evaluation frameworks from customer insights, and drive developer adoption at scale. I'm looking for my next 4-5 year project to apply this expertise.
