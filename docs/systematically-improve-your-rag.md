## The Problem With RAG Today

Over the last few years, "RAG" has become a buzzword, but making these systems genuinely robust and effective often feels like guesswork. Most teams waste time on:

- ❌ Vague metrics like "make the AI better"
- ❌ Random experiments without data
- ❌ Focusing on generation while ignoring retrieval
- ❌ Building one-size-fits-all systems that underperform

This course cuts through the confusion by giving you a clear, repeatable process: from collecting the right data and generating synthetic evaluations, to gradually incorporating new retrieval indices, routing strategies, fine-tuned embeddings, and practical UX improvements.

## What You'll Get

In just 6 weeks, you'll learn a proven system to:

- ✅ **Build Proper Evaluations** - Create synthetic data to measure real improvement
- ✅ **Find What Matters** - Segment queries to identify high-impact opportunities
- ✅ **Improve Search Quality** - Build specialized indices that actually retrieve what users need
- ✅ **Collect Valuable Feedback** - Design UI that generates continuous improvement data
- ✅ **Optimize Embeddings** - Fine-tune models that understand YOUR definition of relevance
