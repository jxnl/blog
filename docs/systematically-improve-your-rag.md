## The Problem

Most RAG implementations fail because teams focus on model selection and prompt engineering while ignoring the fundamentals: measurement, feedback, and systematic improvement.

**Common mistakes:**

- Vague metrics like "make the AI better"
- Random experiments without data
- Focusing on generation while ignoring retrieval
- Building one-size-fits-all systems that underperform

This course gives you a clear, repeatable process: from collecting the right data and generating synthetic evaluations, to routing strategies, fine-tuned embeddings, and practical UX improvements.

---

## What You'll Learn

| Week | Topic | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Foundations & Evaluation | Build synthetic data pipelines, measure precision/recall |
| 3-4 | Retrieval & Routing | Specialized indices, query routing, multi-modal search |
| 5 | Fine-tuning | Custom embeddings, re-rankers, 10-30% recall improvements |
| 6 | Product & UX | Feedback collection, streaming, validation pipelines |

**Core skills:**

- Build proper evaluations with synthetic data
- Segment queries to identify high-impact opportunities
- Create specialized indices for different content types
- Design UIs that generate continuous improvement data
- Fine-tune embeddings for your domain

---

## What Makes This Different

**1. RAG is a recommendation problem, not an AI problem**

"RAG is really just a recommendation system squeezed between two LLMs." Focus on what you can control: improve search quality first, generation quality follows.

**2. Evaluation-first approach**

No more vibe checks. Set up meaningful evaluations, identify high-impact opportunities, and measure every change.

**3. Build improvement flywheels**

Create systems that get better with every user interaction. Continuous refinement based on real feedback.

## Get Reimbursed

!!! note "Email Template for Your Manager"

    Hey {manager},

    I've found a course called "Systematically Improving RAG Applications" that would be valuable for our team:

    - **Expert Instruction**: Learn from Jason Liu, 8 years experience in recommendation systems and RAG
    - **Practical Application**: Hands-on sessions with real datasets and implementation guides
    - **Systematic Approach**: Frameworks for continuous improvement, not one-off fixes
    - **Added Value**: $1,500+ in tool credits included
    - **Risk-Free**: Money-back guarantee if we don't see improvements

    The course costs $1,800. I plan to share learnings with the team. More details: https://maven.com/applied-llms/rag-playbook
