# User Manual

How to work with me effectively. I'm learning to delegate more so I can focus on high-leverage work.

---

## What I Value

- **Constant learning and growth** - I'm driven by the need to learn continuously. I expect the same from my team.
- **Move fast and break things** - Execute fast. If you're wrong, we can fix it later. Don't wait for approval.
- **Asynchronous communication** - I prefer async. If you message me, assume I have 5 minutes to process and respond.
- **Direct communication** - Keep it yes/no or number-based. Be brief. Don't bury important information.
- **Health first** - I have a hand injury. I prefer face-to-face or video feedback over typing.
- **Take ownership** - If the task is hard, I probably didn't give enough details. Ask for what you need.
- **Simplicity** - I hate unearned complexity. If I see a flowchart with 12 things, I lose my mind.

## Pet Peeves

- **Silence** - Not getting updates makes me anxious. "Working on this" or "I'm blocked here" are good messages.
- **Context switching** - Remind me where things are when you update me. Assume I read but don't remember.
- **Lack of feedback** - I need critical feedback regularly. If you're not telling me what could be better, it holds us both back.

## How to Communicate

**Use async first.** Slack or text messages work best. Keep it brief with bullet points.

**I'm often mobile.** Messages should be structured for quick skimming. Put key info at the top.

**Ask specific questions.** Frame questions so they can be answered with yes/no or numbers. "How can I help?" beats "Do you think I should work on X?"

**Prep me for meetings.** Send materials before to reset my focus. Follow up with summary and action items.

## How to Message Me

Message me on Slack. If urgent, text me. Assume I'm opening your message on my Apple Watch. No links, short messages.

**Good practices:**

- **Clear subject lines** - Make the topic immediately apparent
    - Good: "Urgent: Client proposal needs approval by 3pm"
    - Bad: "Quick question"

- **Structure for quick decisions** - Present numbered options
    - Good: "Logo options: 1. Blue 2. Green 3. Red. Which? Default to #1 if no response by EOD."
    - Bad: "What color should we use?"

- **Flag time-sensitive items** - Use [Urgent], [Time-sensitive], or [FYI] prefixes

- **Use visuals** - Screenshots convey information faster than text
    - Good: "New dashboard layout: [screenshot]. Thoughts?"
    - Bad: Long description of layout changes

- **End with clear next step** - What action do you need from me?

- **Keep it short** - Put the ask at the top with clear call to action

- **Ask forgiveness, not permission** - "I'm going to do this, let me know if wrong" beats "What do you think about this?"

---

## How I Prioritize

- **Client work first** - Always be moving things along or waiting for client feedback
- **Fridays for personal work** - If you're full-time, Fridays are good for personal projects
- **Delegate early** - If something isn't clear, ask for clarity now. I'd rather spend time upfront.
- **Tell people you're blocking** - "I'm waiting on you to do X so I can deliver Y by this date, otherwise Z"

---

## Working Together

- **Own your tasks** - Don't wait for approval on every detail. Take action, even if mistakes happen.
- **Give consistent updates** - Silence creates stress. Even small updates help. If you get 1% off every day, you'll be completely off by end of week.
- **Challenge me with feedback** - Tell me what's not working. I need feedback to grow.
- **Follow up after meetings** - Clear summary of next steps and anything needing feedback.

## My Leadership Approach

I'm a new manager. I want to be hands-off. If the team makes a mistake, I shoulder that responsibility as an opportunity to learn how to be a better leader.
